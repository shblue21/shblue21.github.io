A few days ago I posted about RC for Amazon Linux 2023.  
Today it was officially released.  

The release link is below.

In my last post, I outlined the changes in Amazon Linux 2023.  
[Comparison table](https://shblue21.github.io/aws/Amazon-linux-2022-RC-Released/#key-comparisons)

There are many changes to the package manager and base OS, so you may be hesitant to adopt it.  
We recommend using Amazon Linux 2023 for new provisioning.
